Profile Summary:
Computer Science undergraduate skilled in React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and full-stack development.
Hands-on experience in building real-world projects including HealthPal AI and News App, integrating APIs, AI tools, and Firebase for real-time data handling.
Experienced with frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) and backend (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SQL, Firebase).

Internship Experienc:
1)Tellis Techology from  june2025 to july 2025
During my internship at Tellis Technology, I developed responsive web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and integrated 
AI tools to enhance user interaction and functionality. I collaborated with the development team to design and implement animated, modern user interfaces and 
AI-based features such as chatbot support and content generation through third-party APIs. This experience allowed me to gain hands-on expertise in full-stack 
development, API integration, and deploying projects using modern tools and version control systems like Git and GitHub, while working in a collaborative and 
innovative environment.

Projects:
1)Ai Agent Agency  Link:https://tellis-ai-1uog.vercel.app/
This MERN stack project is a modern, visually appealing website developed for an agency to showcase its services. Designed with Aceternity and 
shadcn-based UI components, the interface emphasizes smooth animations, clean layouts, and an engaging user experience. The site features responsive design, 
interactive elements, and a focus on presenting the agency’s offerings in a professional yet creative way. Built with the MERN stack for scalability and performance, 
it combines strong frontend aesthetics with a robust backend foundation to deliver a polished and impactful web presence.
2 )Teams Clone link: https://gotellis.vercel.app/
This project is a Next.js and Tailwind CSS-based frontend application designed for companies to efficiently manage and monitor employees. 
Built primarily through prompting and coding, it provides an intuitive interface for key features such as real-time chat, attendance tracking, project 
assignment, screen monitoring, and employee management. The platform enables organizations to streamline communication, assign and monitor tasks, and 
ensure productivity through an engaging and responsive UI. While the current version focuses on the frontend, it lays a strong foundation for integrating backend 
services and advanced functionalities in the future.

Open Source Contribution:
I have actively contributed to open-source projects through well-known programs such as GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSOC) 2024 and Hacktoberfest, and I am 
currently participating in GSSOC 2025 and Open Source Connect India. My work has included building features, fixing bugs, enhancing UI/UX components, and improving 
project documentation. Collaborating with diverse developer communities on GitHub, I have followed best practices in version control, participated in code reviews, 
and contributed to projects that solve real-world problems. These experiences have strengthened my technical expertise, teamwork skills, and commitment to 
contributing meaningfully to the open-source ecosystem.
